This is the BETA version, which uses the current version of Node.js (18.0.0) with the use and implementation of the "fetch" function to use together with API's. The purpose of this bot is to be fully customizable, easy to access, easy to implement and educational.

Salazar emerged as an alternative to the classic pre-customized BOT's offered on the internet today, in order to be intuitive so that anyone, regardless of their degree of programming experience, can customize and make it look their own. Salazar was the name given to the project that makes the source code available in TypeScript for further studies and pertinent customizations. The name was chosen due to the creator's personal tastes.

All updates will be notified and duly amended in this documentation for a complete reading of the full operation of this BOT. If you are interested in contributing, feel free, your point of view and your implementations are essential for the vital functioning of the project.
